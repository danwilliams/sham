Sham is a collection of useful mocks and fakes for testing Rust code. The
primary purpose is to be able to swap out a genuine implementation and
substitute it with a sham one, in order to achieve deterministic testing
without side effects.

This is particularly useful for testing code that usually performs a particular
operation that is either expensive, slow, or has side effects that are
undesirable in a test environment, such as sending network requests. In these
cases, a sham implementation can be used to simulate the real one, without
actually performing the operation.

The main crate is [`sham`](crates/sham/README.md), and the other crates rely on
it or provide secondary functionality in some way. This repository as a whole
shares a name with the main crate. You can read about the naming and purpose of
each crate in their respective README files.
